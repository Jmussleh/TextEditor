# Text Editor Starter Code
## Description
A text editor as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs in the browser. The single-page application supports offline functionality and data persistence using IndexedDB. Leveraged the "idb" package, used by Google and Mozilla, to store and retrieve data. Implemented webpack for JavaScript files, generating HTML, service workers, and a manifest file. IndexedDB will create a database on app open, automatically saving user content. The "Install" button allows users to download the app icon to their desktops. I registered a service worker with workbox for pre-caching static assets, ensuring efficient offline access and faster load times.
